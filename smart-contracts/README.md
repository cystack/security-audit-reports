## What is Smart Contract Audit?
Smart Contract is a tool to interact with Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Smart Contract Audit (SCA) is a security check performed by cybersecurity experts to ensure that the code on the blockchain of a smart contract is free from bugs or vulnerabilities. Smart Contracts often manage huge amounts of money. So a single bug can lead to huge loss to the users and stakeholders of the application and the ecosystem.

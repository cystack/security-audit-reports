## What is Smart Contract Audit?
Smart Contract is a tool to interact with Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Smart Contract Audit (SCA) is a security check performed by cybersecurity experts to ensure that the code on the blockchain of a smart contract is free from bugs or vulnerabilities. Smart Contracts often manage huge amounts of money. So a single bug can lead to huge loss to the users and stakeholders of the application and the ecosystem.

## CyStack SCA
CyStack's assessment solution analyzes the source code and the implementation of the customer's Smart Contract on the Blockchain network to detect errors and security vulnerabilities, thereby proposing improvements and solutions. The testing process includes static analysis, dynamic analysis, and interaction analysis with other Smart Contracts, using advanced testing tools and manual reviewers.
